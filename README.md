# module1-html-css-refactoring

## Description
This project contains the first homework which is regarding CSS refactoring. In this homework I took the provided code and reduced the amount of redundancy by consolidating and simplifying css selectors and modifying the HTML code to match the changes made.
This project helped me learn how to refactor code to make it more "dry" and easier to read without modifiying the functionality of the site itself.
